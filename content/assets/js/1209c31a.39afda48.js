If the zookeeper server doesn't hear anything from the client for this amount of time, any leases which the client holds will be timed out. This is important in leader election.

However, their claim on the lease will remain in the cue. If the first instance then goes away, due to a crash etc., its session will timeout. Once the session times out, the lease will be released and the next instance in the queue will become the leader. The call to autoRequeue() will make the client queue itself again if it loses the lease for some other reason, such as if it was still alive, but it a garbage collection cycle caused it to lose its session, and thereby its lease. I've set the lease to be quite low so that when we test out leader election, transitions will be quite quick. The optimum length for session timeout depends very much on the use case. The other parameters are the connection timeout, i.e. the amount of time it will spend trying to connect to a zookeeper server before giving up, and the retry policy.
